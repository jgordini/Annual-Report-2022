          <h2>Champions of Excellence</h2>
          <p>
            In 2022, UAB IT set out to achieve four metrics: at least 100 wins
            for campus; strong customer satisfaction ratings; and consistent
            service availability and service level agreement timeframes. All of
            those metrics are designed to deliver innovation and dependability
            &mdash; in short, to delight our customers. We champion excellence
            in our own work, so that our technology solutions can help empower
            UAB students, faculty, researchers and staff to achieve excellence.

            <strong>Digital transformation</strong><br />
            Many of UAB IT&rsquo;s 2022 wins are steps toward a digital
            transformation of the UAB campus &mdash; and much of UAB IT&rsquo;s
            2022 work was dedicated to projects that will help take UAB into the
            future, including a new student portal that will debut in early
            2023, in partnership with University Relations. In the past year,
            UAB IT has worked to streamline processes for requesting technology,
            creating a
            <a

            and offering a

            >
            to approval for new research technology. Meanwhile, the

              >digital strategy committee </a
            >continues to work on projects designed to delight campus and
            transform the way we work and learn.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>IT of the future</strong><br />
            In addition to technology projects that will transform campus, UAB
            IT is undertaking a transition that will unite IT talent from across
            campus into a new department. As part of the University&rsquo;s RCM
            initiative, UAB IT will welcome IT employees from other departments.
            In many cases, those employees will serve the same faculty and
            staff, but both IT professionals and IT customers will benefit from
            backup and tools in central IT. &ldquo;We are building the IT of the
            future by joining the talent of great teams,&rdquo; said Curtis A.
            Carver Jr., vice president and chief executive officer. Carver
            anticipates central and distributed IT employees learning from each
            other &mdash; and learning new skills to help fill the future roles
            campus will need as technology evolves.

            <strong>A culture of collaboration </strong><br />
            The work of UAB and UAB IT touched people far beyond campus and
            Birmingham in 2022. In July, UAB helped welcome the world to campus
            for The World Games, and IT employees were there to connect them to
            the internet &mdash; and to family and friends back home. &ldquo;UAB
            IT has been an excellent partner, collaborating with us and other
            vendors to ensure that our athletes and staff have a seamless
            technology experience while on campus at UAB,&rdquo; said Justin
            Watson, chief technology officer for The World Games 2022.
